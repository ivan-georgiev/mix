Mostly Uni projects in different languages. I just took the project folders, so the binaries are also there. None of them is something 'live'.

2012-dotNet-Chat/: Simple C# desktop tcp client-server apps with gui. Serializes custom class objects.
2012-Java-Mail-Client/: Prorably the biggest project here. Email(POP3/IMAP) client with GUI and H2 database. 
2013-Coding-Mix/: Criptography implementations (algorithms) written in Java: GaussJordan/  GrayCode/  Huffman/  ReedMuller/  RSA/.
2014-Node/: Simple express application with MySQL database. First steps in async and web development.
2014-Thesis-dotNet/: C# desktop application with MS SQL database. Thesis management solution. Contains also Warehose database and SSIS packages for data migration.
2014-Thesis-PHP-Website/: Related to 2014-Thesis-dotNet. PHP application providing web interface for the MS SQL database.
2016-PythonMix/: First steps in Python. Parsing files, web requests, collections, etc.
2017-Node-SimpleFileUploader/: Simple SPA uploading files to Node backend, which I extended a bit. Added https, dummy authentication with creds in the code, file duplicates handling and similar small stuff. Logging was improved, so I integrated it with fail2ban to block attackers. This was hosted in Docker on my RaspberryPi. 
2018-PythonMix/: Script I used to find duplicates(md5) on the filesystem. Also the first unit tests I wrote.
2020-Powershell/: Powershell functions: Get-GitHash
